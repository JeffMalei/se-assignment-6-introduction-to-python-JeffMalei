# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Key features that make Python popular include:

Easy to Learn and Use: Pythonâ€™s simple syntax emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance.
Extensive Standard Library: Python has a large standard library that provides tools suited to many tasks.
Portability: Python runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows.
Dynamic Typing: Python does not require the declaration of variable types.
Community and Support: Python has a large community, providing extensive documentation, guides, and forums.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Simplifying tasks with scripts.
Software Development: Building complex applications and prototyping.
Education: Teaching programming due to its simplicity.
Installing Python
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Installing Python on Windows
Download Python:

Visit the official Python website.
Download the latest version for Windows.
Install Python:

Run the downloaded installer.
Check the box "Add Python to PATH".
Click on "Install Now".
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt.
Type python --version to verify Python installation.
Type pip --version to verify pip installation.
Set Up Virtual Environment:

Navigate to your project directory.
Run python -m venv env to create a virtual environment.
Activate the environment with env\Scripts\activate.
Python Syntax and Semantics
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

python
print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print is a built-in function used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.
Parentheses () are used to call the function.
Data Types and Variables
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic Data Types:

int: Integer type, e.g., 42.
float: Floating-point number, e.g., 3.14.
str: String type, e.g., "Hello".
bool: Boolean type, e.g., True or False.
list: Ordered collection, e.g., [1, 2, 3].
tuple: Immutable ordered collection, e.g., (1, 2, 3).
dict: Dictionary type, e.g., {'key': 'value'}.
python
Copy code
# Creating and using variables
name = "Alice"         # str
age = 30               # int
height = 5.5           # float
is_student = True      # bool
skills = ["Python", "Data Science"]  # list
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}  # dict

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Is Student: {is_student}")
print(f"Skills: {skills}")
print(f"Person Info: {person}")
Control Structures
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

Conditional Statements:
Used to execute code based on conditions.

python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Loops:
Used to execute a block of code multiple times.

For Loop Example:

python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions:
Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
Lists and Dictionaries
Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections of items.

Dictionaries: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.

python
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "major": "CS"}
student["gpa"] = 3.8
print(student)
Exception Handling
What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception Handling: Mechanism to handle runtime errors.

python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input.")
finally:
    print("This block is always executed.")

Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.

Modules: Files containing Python code, typically functions and classes.

Packages: Collections of modules in a directory with an __init__.py file.

Using a module:

python
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0
File I/O
How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a file:

python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
